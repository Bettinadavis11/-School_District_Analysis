# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
This School District Analysis was created to aid Maria and the school board in upholding state-testing standards, as evidence of academic dishonesty is shown.
The school board is not fully aware of the extend of the academic dishonesty and have asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
