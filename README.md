# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
This School District Analysis was created to aid Maria and the school board in upholding state-testing standards, as evidence of academic dishonesty is shown.
The school board is not fully aware of the extend of the academic dishonesty and have asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
The district summary had a slight decrease in all metrics. However, it was minimal and did not decrease the “Overall Passing %” by much (0.03%).
### How is the school summary affected?
While replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School, we noticed that the “Average Reading Score” increased by a 0.05%, while all other metrics had a minimal decrease.

The only type of school that was affected was the Charter schools, as Thomas High School is a Charter school.
